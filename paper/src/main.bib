    abstract = {Problem
The severity of motorway accidents that occurred on the hard shoulder (HS) is higher than for the main carriageway (MC). This paper compares and contrasts the most important factors affecting the severity of HS and MC accidents on motorways in England.
Method
Using police reported accident data, the accidents that occurred on motorways in England are grouped into two categories (i.e., HS and MC) according to the location. A generalized ordered logistic regression model is then applied to identify the factors affecting the severity of HS and MC accidents on motorways. The factors examined include accident and vehicle characteristics, traffic and environment conditions, as well as other behavioral factors.
Results
Results suggest that the factors positively affecting the severity include: number of vehicles involved in the accident, peak-hour traffic time, and low visibility. Differences between HS and MC accidents are identified, with the most important being the involvement of heavy goods vehicles (HGVs) and driver fatigue, which are found to be more crucial in increasing the severity of HS accidents.
Practical applications
Measures to increase awareness of HGV drivers regarding the risk of fatigue when driving on motorways, and especially the nearside lane, should be taken by the stakeholders.}

Investigation of the characteristics and patterns of RTAs is one of the high-priority issues in traffic safety analysis. This paper presents our work on mining RTAs using association rule based methods. A case study is conducted using UK traffic accident data from 2005 to 2017. We performed Apriori algorithm on the data set and then explored the rules with high lift and high support respectively. The results show that RTAs have strong correlation with environmental characteristics, speed limit, and location. With the network visualization, we can explain in details the association rules and obtain more understandable insights into the results. The promising outcomes will undoubtedly reduce traffic accident effectively and assist traffic safety department for decision making.",

    abstract = {Nowadays, road accident is one of the main causes of mortality worldwide. Then, measures are required to reduce or mitigate the accident impacts. The identification of the most effective measures requires an effective analysis of accidents able to identify and classify the causes that can trigger an accident. This study uses data mining as well as clustering approaches to analyze accident data of the 15 districts of Rome Municipality, collected from 2016 to 2019. The aim is to find out which data mining techniques are more suitable to analyze road accidents, to identify the most significant causes and the most recurrent patterns of road accidents by means of a descriptive analysis. Besides, a model to foresee road accidents is proposed. Results show that such analyses can be a powerful tool to plan suitable measures to reduce accidents as well as to forecast in advance the areas to be pointed out.}

    abstract = {Introduction: The urban road traffic accident (RTA) risks for the city of Zagreb, Croatia, from 1999 through 2000 were analyzed with the aim of reducing the increasing injury incidence. Method: Simple and bivariate analysis using χ2, odds ratio, and confidence interval of 95% was used to determine risks in three outcome groups: killed, severely, and mildly injured. Results: There were 528 RTA victims consisting of 260 severely, 213 mildly injured, and 55 killed at the scene of an accident and during transportation. More fatal accidents occurred during night hours (OR=3.78; 95% CI, 2.08–6.85), on urban road links (OR=2.33; 95% CI, 1.30–4.19), and at exceeding speed limit (OR=2.56; 95% CI, 1.43–4.61). More people were injured than killed on urban junctions (OR=5.27; 95% CI, 2.21–12.57). The highest combined risk of dying or being severely injured was found in males, driving at excessive speed, on urban links, and during bad visibility (OR=16.15; 95% CI, 3.901–66.881). Conclusion: These results will influence the urban traffic police enforcement measures, which will change inappropriate behavior of drivers and protect the least experienced road users.}

ABSTRACT = {Road traffic injury accounts for a substantial human and economic burden globally. Understanding risk factors contributing to fatal injuries is of paramount importance. In this study, we proposed a model that adopts a hybrid ensemble machine learning classifier structured from sequential minimal optimization and decision trees to identify risk factors contributing to fatal road injuries. The model was constructed, trained, tested, and validated using the Lebanese Road Accidents Platform (LRAP) database of 8482 road crash incidents, with fatality occurrence as the outcome variable. A sensitivity analysis was conducted to examine the influence of multiple factors on fatality occurrence. Seven out of the nine selected independent variables were significantly associated with fatality occurrence, namely, crash type, injury severity, spatial cluster-ID, and crash time (hour). Evidence gained from the model data analysis will be adopted by policymakers and key stakeholders to gain insights into major contributing factors associated with fatal road crashes and to translate knowledge into safety programs and enhanced road policies.},

    ABSTRACT = {Portugal has the sixth highest road fatality rate among European Union members. This is a problem of different dimensions with serious consequences in people&rsquo;s lives. This study analyses daily data from police and government authorities on road traffic accidents that occurred between 2016 and 2019 in a district of Portugal. This paper looks for the determinants that contribute to the existence of victims in road traffic accidents, as well as the determinants for fatalities and/or serious injuries in accidents with victims. We use logistic regression models, and the results are compared to the machine-learning model results. For the severity model, where the response variable indicates whether only property damage or casualties resulted in the traffic accident, we used a large sample with a small imbalance. For the serious injuries model, where the response variable indicates whether or not there were victims with serious injuries and/or fatalities in the traffic accident with victims, we used a small sample with very imbalanced data. Empirical analysis supports the conclusion that, with a small sample of imbalanced data, machine-learning models generally do not perform better than statistical models; however, they perform similarly when the sample is large and has a small imbalance.},
